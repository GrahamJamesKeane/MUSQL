# MUSQL_EVAL

MUSQL_EVAL is an open-source web application built with Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy that allows users to evaluate their SQL query-writing skills. The application is designed to be used as a learning tool in database courses and provides users with a friendly web interface for writing and evaluating SQL queries. The project includes a grading engine that evaluates queries against a set of test cases and provides users with immediate feedback on their query's correctness.

The application has a set of models for managing user accounts, assignments, and results. Users can register and log in to the system, access a list of available assignments, and submit their solutions for grading. The system stores users' results and provides them with a detailed report on their performance, including the percentage of correct answers for each assignment.

MUSQL_EVAL includes a set of static files (CSS, JavaScript, and images) and templates (HTML files) for the web interface. The project also includes a set of utility functions for managing application data, such as loading test cases and initializing the database.

The project has a comprehensive set of unit tests that cover each component of the application, including the grading engine, models, and views. The project achieves a 100% pass rate on its own test assignments, indicating that the system is working correctly and providing accurate feedback to users.

Overall, MUSQL_EVAL is a powerful tool for learning and practicing SQL query writing. It provides users with immediate feedback on their performance and helps them to identify areas for improvement. The project is open-source and actively maintained, making it a great choice for educators and students looking for a flexible and customizable tool for teaching and learning databases.
